Overview
*********
The `forensicVM` project is a specialized tool designed to facilitate the conversion of forensic images into virtual machine images. This tool is particularly useful in digital forensics and cyber investigation scenarios, where analyzing forensic images in a virtualized environment can provide deeper insights and a controlled setting for investigation.

The `forensicVM` suite includes several scripts and components that work together to automate the process of setting up a virtual machine (VM) environment, converting forensic image formats, and providing an interface for interaction with the converted images. The primary components of `forensicVM` include:

- **run-or-convert.sh**: A script to set up the VM environment and initiate the conversion process of forensic images.
- **forensic2v.sh**: The core script responsible for the actual conversion of forensic images to a VM-compatible format.
- **qemu-img**: A wrapper script for the `qemu-img` command, facilitating image manipulation tasks.
- **Django-based Web Interface**: A web interface for interacting with the virtualized forensic images.

This manual aims to provide comprehensive guidance on installing, configuring, and effectively using `forensicVM`. It is intended for system administrators, digital forensic analysts, and IT professionals who require a reliable and efficient way to conduct forensic investigations in a virtualized environment.

In the following sections, we will delve into the details of installation requirements, configuration steps, usage instructions, and advanced customization options to help you get the most out of `forensicVM`.

2. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**:
   Change to the directory where the repository has been cloned:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd forensicVM

3. **Run the Installation Script**:
   Execute the `install.sh` script with appropriate privileges. This script will install the necessary components and configure the environment for `forensicVM`. Run the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ./setup/install.sh

   Note: The script may prompt for confirmation during the installation of various components.

4. **Verify Installation**:
   After the installation script completes, verify that all components of `forensicVM` are installed correctly. You can check the status of the services or attempt a test run to ensure functionality.

5. **Post-Installation Configuration** (Optional):
   Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to perform additional configuration steps, such as setting up network interfaces or customizing script parameters.

By following these steps, you should have `forensicVM` installed and ready for use on your system. The next section will guide you through the initial configuration and usage of `forensicVM`.
